A **Linear Regression model** is trained on the `Advertising.csv` dataset and saved as `Sales_predictor_model.pkl`.

##  Files
- `Advertising.csv` → Dataset containing advertising spend vs. sales  
- `SALES PREDICTION.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with full workflow  
- `Sales_predictor_model.pkl` → Trained Linear Regression model  
- `report.pdf` → Detailed project report  
- `requirements.txt` → List of dependencies  

##  Installation
